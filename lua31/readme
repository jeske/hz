* What is Lua?
  Lua is a programming language originally designed for extending applications,
  but also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language.
  Lua combines simple procedural syntax (similar to Pascal) with powerful
  data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible
  semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has
  automatic memory management, making it ideal for configuration, scripting,
  and rapid prototyping.

  Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C,
  and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals
  are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost.

  Lua has been awarded the first prize (technological category) in the Second
  Compaq Award for Research and Development in Computer Science. This award
  is a joint venture of Compaq Computer in Brazil, the Brazilian Ministry of
  Science and Technology, and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.
