# you need an ANSI C compiler. gcc is a popular one.

# if you need compatibility with version 2.5 or older, uncomment the line below.

# if you prefer to use doubles instead of floats, uncomment the following line.
#REAL= -Dreal=double

# if you want support for pipes, uncomment the following line.
# (an implementation of popen() for DOS is available at simtel.)
#POPEN= -DPOPEN

# if your C library is not POSIX compliant, comment the following line.
POSIX= -D_POSIX_SOURCE

# if your C library does not have the newer ANSI functions memmove, strerror,
# and locale support (e.g., in SunOs 4.1.x.), uncomment the following line.
#OLD_ANSI= -DOLD_ANSI

# in SunOs 4.1.x, standard headers in /usr/include are not ANSI,
# so uncomment the following line to avoid prototypes warnings.
#EXTRA_INCS=  -I/usr/5include

# if your system doesn't have (or need) ranlib, change "ranlib" to "true".
RANLIB=ranlib
