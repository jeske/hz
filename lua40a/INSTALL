This is Lua 4.0 (alpha)

* Installation
  ------------
  Building Lua on a Unix system should be very easy:

	1. Edit "config" to suit your platform, if at all necessary.
	2. Do "make".
	3. If you want to install Lua in an "official" place in your system,
	   then do "make install". The official place and the way to install
	   files are defined in "config". You may have to be root to do this.

  See below for instructions for Windows and Macintosh.

* What you get
  ------------
  If "make" succeeds, you get:
	* an interpreter in ./bin/lua and a compiler in ./bin/luac;
	* libraries in ./lib;
	* include files in ./include.
  These are the only directories you need for development.

  There is a reference manual in html in ./doc, some sample code in ./test,
  and some useful stuff in ./etc.
  You don't need these directories for development.

  See also the README files in the various subdirectories.
  A convenient staring point is ./doc/readme.html.

* If you have problems (and solutions!)
  -------------------------------------
  If "make" fails, please let us know (lua@tecgraf.puc-rio.br).
  If you make changes to "config", please send them to us.

* Shared libraries
  ----------------
  If you are running Linux, do the following after "make" succeeds:
	ld -o lib/liblua.so.4.0 -shared src/*.o
	ld -o lib/liblualib.so.4.0 -shared src/lib/*.o
	cd lib
	ln -s liblua.so.4.0 liblua.so
	ln -s liblualib.so.4.0 liblualib.so

  If you want the interpreter to use shared libraries, then do this too:
	rm bin/lua
	cd src/lua; make

  You may need to include lib/ in the LD_LIBRAY_PATH environment variable
  to link programs that use the shared libraries if you don't them in the
  "official" places with "make install".

  Building shared libraries in other systems is similar but details differ.

* Installation on Windows or Macintosh
  ------------------------------------
  The instructions for building Lua on a Mac or Windows machine depend on
  the particular compiler you are using.
  The simplest way is to create a folder with all .c and .h files.
  Then create projects for the basic library, the standard library,
  the interpreter and the compiler, as follows:

  basic lib:	lapi.c lauxlib.c lbuffer.c lbuiltin.c lcode.c ldebug.c ldo.c
		lfunc.c lgc.c llex.c lmem.c lobject.c lparser.c lref.c lstate.c
		lstring.c ltable.c ltm.c lundump.c lvm.c lzio.c

  standard lib:	linit.c ldblib.c liolib.c lmathlib.c lstrlib.c

  interpreter:	basic lib, standard lib, lua.c

  compiler:	basic lib, dump.c luac.c opcode.c opt.c print.c stubs.c test.c

  Of course, to use Lua as a library, you'll have to know how to create
  and use libraries with your compiler.
